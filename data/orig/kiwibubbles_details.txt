"Kiwi Bubbles" is a masked name for a shelf-stable juice drink, aimed primarily at children, which is sold as a multipack with several single-serve containers bundled together. 

Prior to national launch, it underwent a year-long test conducted in two of IRI's BehaviorScan markets. 

The file kiwibubbles_tran.txt contains purchasing data for the new product, drawn from 1300 panelists in Market 1 and 1499 panelists in Market 2. (We only have purchasing data for the new product.)

In Market 1, 205 panelists made at least one purchase of the new product during the 52 week test period; in Market 2, 139 panelists made at least one purchase of the new product during the 52 week test period.

The file kiwibubbles_mktmix.txt contains market-level (not store-level) information on the marketing activity over the 52 weeks the new product was in the test market. We have a standard scanner data measure of promotional activity (i.e., %ACV with any promotion) and measures of advertising (GRPs) and coupon activity. To account for carryover effects, the advertising and coupon measures are expressed as standard exponentially-smoothed "stock" variables.
